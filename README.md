Flame Patience is a selection of Patience card-games (aka Solitaire in the USA).

Currently it contains 9 games, including Freecell, Klondike Draw 1 and Klondike
Draw 3, but it also has several other interesting and more challenging Patience
games.

It features rapid, smooth animation and easy gameplay. Moves are made by tapping
or dragging cards. All moves can be undone or redone. The Rules and Tips for
each game are available instantly on demand and there is an option to show cards
that can be played in the next move.

At any point in a game, including when you have lost, you can request a new
type of game, a new deal of the same type of game or a restart and redeal of
the current game. When you win a game, there is a short celebration and then a
new game of the same type is dealt.
