Flame Patience is a selection of Patience card-games (aka Solitaire in the USA).

Currently it contains 9 games, including Freecell, Klondike Draw 1 and Klondike
Draw 3, but it also has several other interesting and more challenging Patience
games, such as Forty & Eight, Mod 3 and Yukon.

All games feature rapid, smooth animation and easy gameplay. Moves are made by
tapping or dragging cards. If a card can go out, you just need to tap it and it
will "fly" to its position in the solution. Also a move can be started before
the animation of the previous move finishes - which further speeds up play.

Several features make life easier if you are new to a game - or even if you are an expert. Moves can be undone or redone quickly and easily. The Rules and Tips
of the game are available instantly on demand and there is an option to show
cards that can be played in the next move.

At any point in a game, including when you have lost, you can request a new
type of game, a new deal of the same type of game or a restart and redeal of
the current game (if you would like to have another go at it).

When you win a game, there is a short celebration and then a new game of the
same type is dealt automatically.
